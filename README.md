<h3>The Book of Statistical Proofs</h3>

This repository contains a demo for an envisaged project, a collection of statistical proofs. The book consists of four chapters (I: General Theorems; II: Probability Distributions; III: Statistical Models; IV: Model Selection) and in its current state, it only contains one example proof per chapter, ranging from well-known ones (such as "<a href="https://github.com/JoramSoch/TBSP/blob/master/Proofs/mlr-ols.tex">ordinary least squares for multiple linear regression</a>") to less well-known ones (such as "<a href="https://github.com/JoramSoch/TBSP/blob/master/Proofs/lme-anc.tex">partition of the log model evidence into accuracy and complexity</a>"). A template file for adding new proofs <a href="https://github.com/JoramSoch/TBSP/blob/master/Proofs/_Template_.tex">is also available</a>.
