This repository contains a demo for an <a href="https://de.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Fellow-Programm_Freies_Wissen/Einreichungen/The_Book_of_Statistical_Proofs">envisaged project</a> the core objective of which is to collect as many statistical proofs as possible into a centralized, open and collaboratively edited archive, named "The Book of Statistical Proofs" (TBSP). Goals within this project are (i) to work out a taxonomy of statistical proofs, (ii) to choose an implementation for the proof archive and (iii) to collect statistical proofs from distributed sources.

TBSP consists of four chapters:
- Chapter I: General Theorems
- Chapter II: Probability Distributions
- Chapter III: Statistical Models
- Chapter IV: Model Selection

In its current state, TBSP only contains two example proofs per chapter, ranging from well-known ones (such as "<a href="https://github.com/JoramSoch/TBSP/blob/master/Proofs/mlr-ols.tex">ordinary least squares for multiple linear regression</a>") to less well-known ones (such as "<a href="https://github.com/JoramSoch/TBSP/blob/master/Proofs/lme-anc.tex">partition of the log model evidence into accuracy and complexity</a>"). A template file for adding new proofs <a href="https://github.com/JoramSoch/TBSP/blob/master/Proofs/_Template_.tex">is also available</a>.
